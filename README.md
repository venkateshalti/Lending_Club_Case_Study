Lending Club Case Study

We have a dataset with information related to loans given to multiple individuals. Identification of defaulters using EDA is the aim of this case study. The aim is to identify patterns which indicate if a person is likely to default, which may be used for taking actions such as denying the loan, reducing the amount of loan, lending (to risky applicants) at a higher interest rate, etc.
